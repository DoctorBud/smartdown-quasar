0.0.8 - Update deps. Adds OpenJSCAD.md example to gallery. Establish use of VERSIONS.md for release notes. Modernizes publish.sh to work with latest GitHub Pages changes; also creates a 404.html to support URL routing via subpaths. Add darkslateblue background to SourceEditor.vue. Via quasar.conf.js, enable use of SMARTDOWN_PREFIX environment variable to adjust the prefix path for Smartdown resources.
0.0.9 - Replace usage of vue-prism-editor with monaco-editor. Add ExternalData demo (WIP). Implement the ability to navigate within a page via the heading anchors. Add a 'version' field to 'SQ'. Remove blocks_helper.js and starter.js, which were not being used. Simplified and cleaned some gallery examples. Improved quasar.conf.js so that it works with SMARTDOWN_PREFIX being a path or a local server.
0.0.10 - Update deps. This version mostly being created to fixup a previous error where I incorrectly published 0.0.9 as version 0.0.10.
